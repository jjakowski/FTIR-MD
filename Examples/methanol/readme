This folder   contains an example of methanol  spectrum obtained from  30ps  MD with  DFTB+ using NVT at T=333.15K.


   out-dipole-freqs_cm.pdf    # IR  spectrum dipole autocorrelation function 
   out-freqs_cm.pdf           # power spectrum from velocity autocorrelation function

Notice that this is obtained from a single MD run of a single molecule. Therefore the  intensities may not be representative.
It is better to run an ensemble of trajectories. Also the effect of NVT si not really clear and it may affect intensities and frequencies.
