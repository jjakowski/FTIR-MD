#  Here are the IR/Raman  results for CO2  in gas phase obtained from 100 MD simulations with NVE and initial T=300K
#
#   1) First I run 100 MD on expanse, for each MD run  the IR/power  spectra  were  generated 
#       The folder ../run-1   shows MD results from one such  run 
#
#   2) All the spectra from  summed using the script "do-sum-FTIR".  
#        Only the combined  results (of all IR/power spectre added up) are shown here

#  3) The lorentzian broadenig is applied to "raw" (unbroadened) files  toadjust the broadening. 
#    The *w2.dat" file are too  much washed up, which hides some spectral feautures.
#   Using  narrower Lorenztian broadening (k=8) nicely exposes the  "wings" of the  CO2 bending  (peak near 550cm-1).
#    in agreement with experimental resutls from NIST.
#   The  "wings"  on both sides of bending peak are due to anharmonicity.
